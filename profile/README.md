_Presenteer_ (/prez(ə)ntɪə(r)/) is a presentation engine for developers.

There are plethora of choices when it comes to picking a presentation software: from built-in archaic applications to online editors that feel clunky and limit your ideas instead of empowering them. Precise content positioning? Takes time. Gorgeous slide animations? Impossible.

That's why we've built Presenteer.

## Key Features

Think of Presenteer as Next.js for presentations.

- **Minimalistic**. Your presentation deck is a folder with a bunch of `*.jsx` files. No configurations, setups, dependencies. Control the structure through file-system.
- **Focused**. No configurations, setups, or dependencies. Your presentation is _not_ an app!
